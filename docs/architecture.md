### Architecture Specification Document for VitalEdge Hobbit

---

#### **1. Overview**

VitalEdge Hobbit is a lightweight, Gradio-based internal UI designed to manage, visualize, and experiment with post-Datalake workflows in the Mantle ecosystem. These workflows include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain orchestrations, Machine Learning (ML) models, and other advanced analytics. Hobbit interfaces exclusively with the Datalake through its RESTful APIs, ensuring a streamlined and modular design while preserving system boundaries and governance.

---

#### **2. Objectives**

1. Provide a user-friendly interface for managing Mantle operations.
2. Support seamless interaction with APIs to facilitate experimentation, diagnostics, and workflow orchestration.
3. Enable modular growth by incorporating new workflows and tools without architectural overhauls.
4. Maintain a secure and scalable architecture to ensure reliable operations in a production-like environment.

---

#### **3. System Architecture**

##### **3.1 Core Components**
1. **UI Layer (Gradio Frontend)**:
   - A Gradio-based interface organized into sections and tabs for RAG Operations, ML Operations, and Analytics.
   - Allows for intuitive navigation and interaction with Mantle workflows.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Encapsulates API calls to the Datalake and other Mantle components.
   - Handles data retrieval, processing, and integration for the frontend.
   - Implements error handling, retries, and logging for robustness.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Relies entirely on Datalake REST APIs for data access.
   - Ensures clean separation of concerns by delegating all data operations to the API layer.
   - Provides caching mechanisms for improved performance.

4. **Utilities**:
   - Common helper functions for logging, configuration, and request handling.
   - Encapsulates reusable logic for better maintainability.

##### **3.2 Logical Flow**
- **User Interaction**:
  - Users interact with the UI to select tasks (e.g., querying studies, testing workflows).
  - Inputs are validated and dispatched to the service layer.
- **Service Invocation**:
  - The service layer calls Datalake APIs or other external services based on user input.
  - Processes the API response into a format suitable for the frontend.
- **Data Rendering**:
  - Results are dynamically rendered in the Gradio UI for visualization and further action.

#### **5. Integration Points**

1. **Datalake APIs**:
   - All data interactions are routed through the Datalake RESTful API.
   - Supports modular API additions without changes to the core architecture.

2. **External Services**:
   - Embeddings, LLM, and VectorDB are accessed through dedicated APIs.
   - Future integration with other Mantle components is seamless due to the modular service layer.

3. **Authentication**:
   - User authentication is managed through a token-based mechanism compatible with Datalake and other APIs.
   - Future enhancements include role-based access controls for sensitive operations.

---

#### **6. Security Considerations**

- **API Security**:
  - All service calls are authenticated using secure tokens.
  - Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.
- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based access ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- **Logging**:
  - Comprehensive logging for all user actions and API interactions for audit and debugging purposes.
