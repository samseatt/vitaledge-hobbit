### Vision and Objectives Document for VitalEdge Hobbit

---

#### **Vision**

The VitalEdge Hobbit is an internal, lightweight, and extensible Gradio-based user interface designed to streamline and manage Mantle operations within the VitalEdge ecosystem. Hobbit empowers domain experts, data scientists, and engineers to visualize, monitor, and intervene in post-Datalake workflows. These workflows encompass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain orchestrations, LLM fine-tuning, and ML pipelines. By serving as a bridge between the VitalEdge Datalake and advanced analytical or generative systems, Hobbit facilitates informed decision-making, operational agility, and iterative development.
